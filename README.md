This project takes in a test file from the `in/` directory and spits your output to a file with the same test number in the `out/` directory.

You can run this entire system using the `run.sh` script like so:
`./run.sh [-t] [testNo]`

Specifying the optional -t flag uses the Test runner instead of the Main runner. You can specify which test number to run with the optional -n flag (followed by the #).
